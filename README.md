Neurological model of color-based prevalence-induced concept change

This project is an extension of my previous work on prevalence-induced concept change, where a continuous and biased exposure to colors lead to a change in conceptual boundary.

Here, conceptual boundary means the division line between colors. For example, between blue and purple, there is a point at which we would consciously call the color blue (or purple) over the other. Through biased exposure to one of the two colors, 
this leads to a change in the division between the two colors.

Here, we look at this chance through the lens of neural habituation, where this perceptual change happens in the neural level rather than the decision-making level.
The image files show the change over time that appears due to the change in color exposure.
